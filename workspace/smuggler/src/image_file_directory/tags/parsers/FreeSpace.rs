			For long slices, it is possible the memory is used more than once, either for the same slice size or for one larger or smaller.
			Nothing in the TIFF spec prevents this, although it seems unlikely to occur in practice as a writer would have to identify 'identical' chunks of memory.
			Overlapping slices are thus possible.
			
			There is a BTreeMap backed collection, RangeMap, but I'm not really convinced.
			
			I know I looked at Hashbrown before for this - it might be worth looking at again.
				We can turn an index into a stable hash, for example, by rounding-down
					eg Index => Index / 64
				
				At each stable hash, we store a small structure, giving the first previous Index and the first next Index
				
				Alternatively, we store an enum
				
					AllUsed
					AllFree
					PartlyFree
					{
						Vec<Sorted Ranges of Free>,
					}
				
			
			Another technique
				Just add the ranges to a Vec; sort at the end; would need lots of memory
				Could sort-of merge as we go but would

	Even then, since LONG is much more common thant SHORT and BYTE is rarely used, the 'crumbs' will mostly not exist, and, if they do, they will be 2 bytes.
