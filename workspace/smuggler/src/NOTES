OffsetSchema / or is it SchemaOffset?
	(hex. 0xEA1D, dec. 59933) in an attempt to patch a deficiency in the EXIF maker note specification. This tag represents the offset difference between the original maker note location in the EXIF and the new location after editing, and is designed to allow the maker note tag values to be accessed after the location of the maker notes is changed by editing the EXIF

	The EXIF/TIFF format specifies that tags must be stored in numerical order, the maker note tag (hex. 0x927C) comes before the OffsetSchema tag (hex. 0xEA1D).

	One solution here, if we don't want to parse maker notes, is to keep their position (or, if the MS tag is present, move their position back to where it should be). This makes it slightly tricky when writing a file, but it is do-able, although there may be a lot of space wasted.
